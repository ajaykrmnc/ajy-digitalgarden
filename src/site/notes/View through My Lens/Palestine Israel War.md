It's been a whole year since I'm following the Israel Palestine War news. and I'm totally sure this war will be recorded in the history of 21st century. The whole Gaza been destroyed and converted it into debris and shells and most of people have been fled away from country and become a refugee in countries like Iran and Turkey. The war has led to ten of thousand of casualties,  widespread destruction and humanitarian crisis.  I always wanted to write about it but never felt so confident about it. While roaming around the city of  Liverpool I witnessed a huge crowd  is support and asking justice for Palestinians with huge banners and spreading the cards which mentioned which organisation are funding the Israel Palestine war to stop supporting like Barclays McDonald and I was unknowingly eating burger at the McDonald while carrying the badge of Barclays and it really scared me ðŸ¥¶ðŸ˜ƒ. In this article I will try my best to put my viewpoint on it. 

## Diplomatic Perspective
***
I searched it on wikipedia and the name of topic is "Israel-Palestine conflict" and it really  think it much more than a conflict It's a war now. Key aspect of this war is Israel occupation of  Gaza strip and west bank Palestine freedom of movement. There is more than Israel in this game. More countries like America and Iran also been a part of this war game. Israel is hugely supported by the America both financially military aid and diplomatic backing in the UN and also sharing the intellectual system like sharing the drone system. As we also know that the Israel is also so much ahead in the intelligence system and there famous in-house cyber intelligence agency is Mossad and which is highly famous cyber unit is unit 8200 which is highly famous for spy activity and searching any accused in any country in every corner of the world. Another country which is highly engaged in this conflict is Iran supporting Hezbollah, while Qatar, Egypt and Turkey is involved diplomatically. Major devastation occur was in Gaza with more than 53000 have been killed till date [^1]
