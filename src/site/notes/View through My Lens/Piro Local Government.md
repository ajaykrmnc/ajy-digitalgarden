While going back to home after completing my graduation at IIT Dhanbad in train I sat with the two people both from rajputs(yeah they do ask about my caste and \[fyi] caste is very important to judge people in Bihar) and  It appear that from their loud conversation that they were rich and some political party member having 2-3 acres of land and It .

- **Tarari** (No. 196) ~ \[Earlier Piro] - Vishal Prashant \[Member of Bihar Assembly]
- **Jagdishpur** (No. 197)
- **Shahpur** (No. 198)
